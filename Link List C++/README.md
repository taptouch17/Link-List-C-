# Some Simple (Linear) ADTs

## List ADT
To compile, use the command `make list`

The relevant files are
+ List.h
+ List.cpp
+ ListClient.cpp (**To be completed**)


## Stack ADT

 Stack clients have been written already. Each client does the same thing.


### Vector Implementation

To compile, use the command `make stackv`

The relevant files are
+ StackV.h
+ StackV.cpp (**To be completed**)
+ StackVclient.cpp



### List ADT Implementation
To compile, use the command `make stackl`

The relevant files are
+ StackL.h
+ StackL.cpp (**To be completed**)
+ StackLclient.cpp

### Linked-list Implementation
To compile, use the command `make stackll`

The relevant files are
+ StackLL.h
+ StackLL.cpp (**To be completed**)
+ StackLLclient.cpp
